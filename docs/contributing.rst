Contributing to the Docs
========================

Help files are written in reStructuredText format and the website is generated by `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_. See `Getting Started with Sphinx <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html>`_ from readthedocs for a great introduction.
Out of resources linked therein, the `reStructuredTextPrimer <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`_ is especially handy.

You can edit the .rst files to change the documentation.

The source files are hosted `on GitHub <https://github.com/nencki-lobi/lobi-inhouse>`_. Feel free to open pull requests, contribute directly (if you were added as collaborator) or open issues (if you would like something to be added, but you don't feel up to writing that yourself).
